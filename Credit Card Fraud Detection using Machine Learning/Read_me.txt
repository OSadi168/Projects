This project focuses on the critical task of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions by analysing transaction data and developing a robust machine learning system. The goal is to train, test, and deploy advanced models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machine, to accurately flag suspicious activities. 

For the moment I have used Logistic Regression one of the three algorithms. Currently I am working on create a simulated website.
