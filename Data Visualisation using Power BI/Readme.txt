This project focuses on transforming raw data into compelling visual narratives through exploratory analysis and dashboard design. It involves formulating a research question, sourcing and preparing data, and applying univariate and multivariate analysis to uncover patterns and relationships.
This project demonstrates the use of Power BI to transform raw salary datasets into clear, actionable insights. The work involved:

1. Data Preparation: Cleaning and structuring datasets for analysis.
2. Exploratory Analysis: Identifying trends across countries, job roles, and experience levels.
3. Interactive Dashboards:
    - Salary comparisons across countries and job categories.
    - Remote vs in-person salary differences.
    - Trends in average salary by experience level over time.
    - Role-specific salary benchmarks in the UK and US.
4. Storytelling with Data: Designed dashboards to communicate insights effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
