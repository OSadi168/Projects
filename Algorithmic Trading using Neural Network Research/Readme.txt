This project explores the application of artificial intelligence techniques to solve real-world problems using supervised and unsupervised learning. It involves data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation across multiple algorithms, with a focus on ethical considerations and interpretability. The work demonstrates practical implementation of AI methods using Python and scikit-learn, supported by critical analysis and stakeholder-oriented reporting.
